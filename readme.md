# StonePaperScissor-Game

StonePaperScissor-Game is a simple command-line interface game implemented in C. The game is a classic two-player game where each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the choices made by the players. 

## How to Run

To run the game, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. Once you have installed a C compiler, you can download the code from the GitHub repository and compile it in your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the directory where you saved the code and typing the following command:

gcc -o game game.c


The game will then be compiled, and you can run it by typing the following command:

./game


## Gameplay

The game will then start, and you will be prompted to enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The game will then determine the winner based on the choices made by the players.

The game has been implemented with error handling to ensure that only valid inputs are accepted. Additionally, the game allows you to play multiple rounds, and it keeps track of the scores of each player.
